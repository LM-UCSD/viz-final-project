    <h1> COVID-19: US Socioeconomic Factors</h1>
    <p> This is an exploration of Socioeconomic factors in the US related to COVID-19 outcomes. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laurindogarcia/covid-19-race-gender-poverty-risk-us-county/data?select=covid_data_log_200922.csv" target="_blank">Link to Data</a></p>
    <h3>Bar Chart</h3>
    <p>This display shows a reactive filter with the count of deaths split by gender. The buttons along the bottom allow the user to view different ethnic groups, and the y-axis will update with the count of deaths.
    </p>  
    <h3>Dot Plot</h3>
    <p>This display is similar to the bar chart, except that it shows a case count represented by dots rather than deaths. The data is still split by gender, and the buttons still filter through ethnic groups. The "Show Male vs Female" button must be pressed to show the color maps.
    </p>  
    <h3>Heat Map</h3>
    <p>This display shows a heatmap of the selected variable by county, where darker red is a higher value. The drop-downs can be selected by the user to compare two features-of-interest; once selected, the "Toggle Features" button can be used to quickly swap between the two variables in order to compare visual differences and look for patterns.</p>  
    <h3>Bubble Map</h3>
    <p>This display pulls in the Mapbox API to display a bubble chart overlay on the US map. The bubbles are scaled to represent risk categories over their counties.
        <br>Note that this page can take a minute or so to load.
        <br>You may need to zoom out to see if it loaded.
    </p>
    <h3>Animated Bar</h3>
    <p>This display shows an animated “bar race” style graph that cycles through death count by state. This way, each state at the top of the chart can be compared to the next 9 below it without having the scale skewed by the larger ones above it. This provides an engaging way to compare state-to-state Covid-19 deaths.
